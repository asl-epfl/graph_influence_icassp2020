This code can be used to generate simulations similar to Fig. 1 in the following paper:

Vincenzo Matta, Virginia Bordignon, Augusto Santos, and Ali H. Sayed, ``Learning graph influence from social interactions,'' Proc. IEEE ICASSP, Barcelona, Spain, May 2020.

Fig. 1 is generated executing file 'codefig1.py'.

Please note that the code is not generally perfected for performance, but is rather meant to illustrate certain results from the paper. The code is provided as-is without guarantees.
